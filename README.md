# Module 3 Challenge – Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
**#Purpose**

    The purpose of the election analysis is to help the election commission gather additional

    of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.

# Election Audit Summary

    If you take a look at the image down below, you’ll see that we were able to provide the election 
    
    commission with a lot more additional information to complete their audit using the existing 
    
    information provided. The script used is quite versatile and can be reused to any election to suit their 
    
    needs, with minor modifications. For example, the easiest method would be to simply open and read 
    
    from a different .csv file or one could add to the existing .csv file to include more information like 
    
    other candidates or counties.
